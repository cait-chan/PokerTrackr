# Poker Tracker App

## Project Proposal

My boyfriend and I host weekly poker nights with our friends and have been using the Notes app on our phones
to keep track of buy-ins and winnings at the end of the night. With every new game this can get tedious to set
up so I want to design a project that we can use moving forward to keep track of all of our poker games and that
is easy for us to set up each time we play again. The application will allow us to create a new poker event and
add the players (want to be able to have a dropdown menu of all previous players if possible, but also be able
to add a new player if needed), the total dollar amount of buy-ins for each player (this should update the total
number for the night), the winnings/losses in dollar amount for each player at the end of the event, the best 
hand played for the event (with the associated player), the time of each game (to keep track of winnings/hour), 
along with all-of-time statistics to look at how each player has done since they first started playing.


## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a new poker event to my total collection of poker events
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of poker events in my poker collection
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a poker event from my poker collection
- As a user, I want to be able to select a poker event from my collection and list the players that played in that 
poker event and their associated statistics, including buy-ins, profit/loss counts, and earnings/hour
